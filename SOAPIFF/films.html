            It is 1956. Previous year, 14-year old Emmett Till from Chicago had gone missing in Money, Mississippi.
            Later, the boy's mutilated body was found in a river. William Bradford Huie of Look magazine sits down with
            the two men acquitted for the boy's murder, Roy Bryant Jr. and J.W. Milam, to discuss the trial. Not a word
            had been uttered outside a courtroom by them or their kin, until now...
          </p>
          <p>
            WOLF CALL (12 Best Film Awards), is the true-story crafted from public record that became a lightning rod
            for moral outrage pivotal in inspiring a whole generation to commit to social change in the 1950s.

            There are many lessons to draw from the South African experience of Apartheid relevant to conflicts all over
            the world. Roadmap to Apartheid explores in detail the apartheid comparison as it is used in the enduring
            Israel-Palestine conflict. As much an historical document of the rise and fall of apartheid, the film shows
            us why many Palestinians feel they are living in an apartheid system today, and why an increasing number of
            people around the world agree with them.

            Project Imagin8ion, a collaboration between Canon and Ron Howard, is the first ever user-generated photo
            contest that invited consumers to inspire a Hollywood production. Ron Howard chose the winning 8 photographs,
            setting the stage for his latest production 'when you find me.' Directed by Bryce Dallas Howard.
          </p>
          <p>
            'when you find me' tells the story of two sisters whose childhood bond is tested by a tragedy they are too
            young to understand. Alternating between past and present, 'when you find me' is an emotional fable of two
            people coping with loss in very different ways, and what it takes to find peace within yourself and
            reconciliation with the ones you love.

            What is good for the factory is good for the family! Winner at Clermon-Ferrand, THE HUMAN FACTOR creates with
            the help of found footage a tragicomical depiction of the birth of the efficiency theories of Frederick
            Taylor. As the story goes, in 1914, an engineer exchanges letters with his wife, while away on a mission to
            reorganize a factory. As he tells her about his experiments in taylorism, she picks up bits and pieces of
            this method and applies it to her daily tasks at home. While the Taylor system starts to disappoint him, his
            wife becomes a true domestic engineer.

            traveling America with hope, humor... and all of their garbage for the year - to explore the good, the bad,
            and the weird across every state in search of the extraordinary innovators and courageous citizens who are
            tackling humanity's greatest environmental crises. As the YERT team layers outlandish eco-challenges onto
            their year-long quest, an unexpected turn of events throws the project for a loop in this award-winning
            docu-comedy. Featuring Bill McKibben, Wes Jackson, Will Allen, Janine Benyus, Joel Salatin, David Orr, and

            It was in the late 70s that a youth culture evolved in the poorer parts of New York which combined several
            disciplines under the name of Hip Hop. Apart from the four classic elements of Graffiti writing, DJing,
            Breakdancing, and Rapping, the musical side of this culture was enhanced by a fifth element called
            ‘Beatboxing’.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the hardship of poverty and the lack of instruments, a pioneer was inspired to imitate
            drum rhythms with his mouth – his brilliance creating the term ‘Human Beatbox’. Very soon other Hip Hop
            artists picked up his style and added this technique of music making to their own shows, but at that time
            beatboxing never left the realm of Hip Hop culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the 80s the first big wave of beatboxing
            was over and beatboxing only existed in an underground scene. It took until the late 90s that the art of
            Human Beatboxing was explosively revived. At that time the Internet had emerged and offered new ways of
            communication for young artists. All of a sudden beatboxers from all over the world were given the opportunity
            to connect and share their knowledge on websites through videos and online tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then Human
            Beatboxing has become a global phenomenon, which is organized and celebrated in the annual Beatbox Conventions
            and through Beatbox Competitions, that are being held in an increasing number of countries every year. The
            documentary aims at providing a full picture of this incredible art form starting with its genesis within Hip
            Hop Culture and continuing with its further developments and its use in various musical fields in several
            countries throughout the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The documentary features artists from New York, California, Florida, Spain,
            the Netherlands, Great Britain, Belgium, Canada, Austria and Germany, who demonstrate their amazing techniques,
            which often seem impossible to audiences at first sight, but see for yourselves…

            to special needs classrooms. Though guaranteed a free, appropriate public education by the Individuals with
            Disabilities Education Act of 1975, children with complex, multiple disabilities often struggle to gain access
            to a typical classroom of their peers. Certain Proof unveils the life of three families and the individual

            Erengo Suto, who provides animation for "King of the Hill." The film stars Catherine Reitman (Knocked Up, I
            Love You Man, My Super Ex-Girlfriend) and Abby Wathen (Third Watch, Young & the Restless). Music supervisor
            Michelle Crispin placed many talented independent artists in the film, including: Willy Porter, Joey Ryan,
            Caitlin Moe, Alexandra Monir, Bernadette Moley, and Heather Holley.

            Ian (George Newbern) doesn't have the greatest relationship with his father, Richard (David Rasche). The
            problem is that Ian resents Richard for being absent during his childhood, and Richard thinks Ian is overreacting.
            When Ian agrees to visit his father for Christmas in Park City, Utah, he brings a couple of friends: Dave
            (Danny Nucci), who wants to lose his virginity, and Keaton (Neill Barry), who is dealing with his sister's
            pregnancy crisis and romantic hints from a longtime friend.
