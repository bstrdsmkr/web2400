            SOAPIFF is now in its seventh year of bringing some of the best independent films in the world to the region.
            SOAPIFF’s roots are firmly in the South, but its branches reach far and wide. SOAPIFF was inspired by the
            Sinking Creek Film Festival, originally founded by the late Mary Jane Coleman in Greeneville, Tennessee. In
            2005 Mark Compton started the SOAPIFF in nearby Johnson City as his graduate thesis project in tourism and
            development. It has since grown into one of the most diverse film festivals in the country, showcasing films
            from all over the world, many of which have gone on to greater acclaim after receiving their premier screening
            with the festival. The festival will present its Seventh Annual screening of films this year at The Knoxville
            Museum of Art and on each campus of Pellissippi State Community College from November 12th to November 18th.

            In its very first year, SOAPIFF premiered the independent horror film Five Across the Eyes, filmed in the
            Tri-Cities area, which went on to gain a European distribution deal after winning the festival’s Best of Fest
            award. Films like Basement Jack, Good Dick, and Virtual JFK have also gone on to further acclaim after screenings
            at the festival. Margaret Mitchell: American Rebel, by executive producer and writer Pamela Roberts, was
            broadcast nationally on PBS in 2012. In its seven years, SOAPIFF has hosted world premieres for films from
            Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.

            The Southern Appalachian International Film Festival is also proud to present the annual Mary Jane Coleman
            Award. Given in honor of the founder of the Sinking Creek Film Celebration, the award is given to individuals
            and artists who promote and encourage film production in the American South. Previous winners of the Mary
            Jane Coleman Award include Linn Sitler, one of the longest-serving film commissioners in the world at the
            Memphis and Shelby County Film and Television Commission; Ted Hatfield, Director of Film Marketing at Regal
            Entertainment Group; and Appalshop, the media collective dedicated to documenting and preserving Appalachian
            culture and tradition.
